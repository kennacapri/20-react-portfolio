# 20-React-Portfolio

## Description
This website is a portfolio about me. It is for employers looking for candidates with experience building single page applications.

## Usage
When the user opens the application they are presented with a header, content section and a footer. When you view the navigation titles, you will see home, about, skills, portfolio and contact. Home, takes you to the top of the page, about takes you to the next section with a short paragraph about me and a picture, skills, shows several coding applications I have experience using, portfolio, takes you to a section with thumbnails and demos of some of my recent work and the contact section lets you enter in your name, email and message which I will have access to. The four tabs on the left side of my website are links to LinkedIn, GitHub, my email and my resume. At the bottom of the page is a footer.
